Thinkful Tube: Challenge

For this project, you will build a page with a simple search form that allows the user to search YouTube videos. Based on the search results the page will display thumbnail images of videos that match the search.

Build the YouTube search app described above. Sketch exactly what you want to build, and try describing in English each feature you'd like to build. It should be similar to the OMDB app you made in the earlier assignment.

Bonus task:
Once you get the thumbnails to appear, make them clickable. Each thumbnail should link to the YouTube page that plays that video.
